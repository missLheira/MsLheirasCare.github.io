          <h2 class="mt0"><b>My Personal Journey As A Mom</b></h2>
          <p>I gave birth to my firstborn in 2009. Two years later, I had my second child, and a year after that, my youngest was born. I raised all of them on my own from birth until my eldest reached five years old. In 2016, I moved to the United States, which meant leaving them behind.</p>
          <p>This significant life change is one of the reasons I chose to become a nanny as my first job in the US, despite having a degree in business management. I haven't been able to go home for nine years, and I miss my children immensely. Thankfully, their paperwork is in process, and I hope they will join me here by next year.</p>
          <p>They are my backbone and the biggest reason why I chose this line of work. My love and dedication to them drive me to provide the best care and support to the families I work with, treating each child as if they were my own.</p>
          <p>In 2023, I welcomed my youngest child into the world. I cherish the moments spent with him on my days off. When I'm at work, my family members step in to care for him at home, allowing me to focus on work without worrying about daycare. Their support means a lot to me, and it's comforting to know he's in loving hands while I'm away.</p>

          <p>I work for the Wyble family every Monday, Friday, and half-day on Saturday. They have a set of 3-year-old twins, Joseph and Pia, and a 2-year-old named Marren. My schedule is from 7 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.</p>
          <p>On a typical workday, I arrive at 7 AM and start by changing the twins out of their pajamas, then I help Marren get dressed. I prepare and serve them breakfast while their parents get ready for work or errands.</p>  
          <p>Throughout the day, I engage the kids in playtime and also handle household tasks such as washing dishes, changing their bedsheets, doing laundry for both the children and parents, and meal prepping for the week—including pancakes, burritos, smoothies, and more. I also cook dinner for the family most days.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I vacuum and mop, rotate and sanitize the kids’ toys, clean their rooms and humidifiers, and take them out to the park or library. In March 2025, Kimmy will give birth, and I will be assisting her with newborn care as well.</p>
          <p>I serve as both a nanny and a mom’s helper for the family, and I truly love staying busy with both the kids and household tasks!</p>

          <p>I have the absolute pleasure of spending time with the sweet and energetic Archer 2–3 times a week, for about 10 hours a day. While his parents are at work, I get to care for him, and we make the most of our time together with plenty of fun and engaging activities around the house. </p>
          <p>Archer’s favorite game is playing chase—he loves the thrill of running around and giggling as I chase him, and it's a game we never tire of! We don’t do screen time, so aside from his regular sleeping and eating routines, our focus is entirely on hands-on, interactive play.</p> 
          <p>Whether we’re exploring his toys, building with blocks, or enjoying walks in the morning and afternoon, I love seeing his curiosity and energy unfold each day. Alongside caring for Archer, I also assist his family with light housekeeping duties.</p> 
          <p>I help out by folding laundry, tidying up the kitchen, vacuuming, and preparing meals for Archer. This arrangement will continue until August 2025, when Archer will start Montessori school.</p> 
          <p>It’s been incredibly rewarding to watch him grow and develop, and I’m so grateful to be a part of his early years, offering support to both him and his parents during this special time.</p>

          <p>Meet Emori, my son’s best friend! Every Saturday, she comes over to our home, and I care for her like she’s one of my own. At 2 years old, she’s only a year older than my son, which makes their time together extra special.</p>
          <p>Whether we’re heading to the park, exploring fun spots like Peek and Play in Grapevine or Kids Empire, or simply playing at home, we’re always creating memories. </p>
          <p>The joy on their faces as they discover new places and activities is priceless, and I love watching them bond over shared adventures.</p>
          <p>At home, Emori and I bake, cook, and enjoy a variety of activities, from arts and crafts to storytime. It’s amazing to see how much she and my son learn from each other as they explore the world around them.  </p>
          <p>Their friendship is such a gift, and I’m so grateful to have her in our lives. These Saturdays are a highlight of my week, and I look forward to watching both of them grow and continue to build their special connection.</p>

          <p>I began my journey with this family when the twins were a mere 6 days old, marking my debut as their first daytime nanny. Demonstrating unwavering commitment and reliability over several months, I earned the role of their primary caregiver and household manager. In those critical early weeks postpartum, I dedicated myself almost around the clock, aiding the mother until she regained her strength and we found a suitable replacement nanny.</p>
          <p>Guiding the twins through their infancy, I meticulously crafted daily routines, organized and maintained the nursery, and adeptly juggled responsibilities such as preparing nourishing meals, bathing the babies, attending their doctor's appointments, and administering medications as prescribed. I seamlessly assisted the mother with a myriad of tasks, ensuring her peace of mind and allowing her to fully focus on her recovery and the twins' wellbeing. Moreover, I took charge of interviewing and hiring additional nannies to cover their 24/7 care needs, ensuring continuity and excellence in childcare.</p>
          <p>After hiring more nannies to join us, I continued working for the family 40 hours a week on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.</p>

          <p>I started taking care of Prableen when she was just 1 week old. Her dad works from home, working remotely, while her mom works nearly every day at a local hospital. My daily responsibilities include nurturing Prableen, taking her for walks in the neighborhood park, bathing and changing her, as well as organizing and tidying up all of her belongings. We spend our time together engaged in playful activities that don't involve screen time, encouraging her development through interactive games and storytelling.</p>    
          <p>In addition to childcare, I also assist the family with housekeeping duties such as vacuuming, mopping the floors, unloading the dishwasher, and keeping the kitchen counters tidy. Over the months of working closely with them, I became an integral part of their daily routine, ensuring that their home runs smoothly and efficiently.</p>
          <p>After careful consideration, the parents decided to enroll Prableen in daycare due to cost considerations. Despite this change, they generously offered to support me in finding a new family to work with. During this transitional period, they allowed me to continue working for an additional month while I searched for a suitable replacement. Although our daily interactions have reduced, we still keep in touch from time to time, sharing updates and maintaining a bond formed through caring for Prableen</p>

          <p>This is about my experience working with Naya and Sanya over the course of a year. When I began, the younger child was just 2 years old and not yet attending school, so I dedicated nearly 50 hours per week to caring for them. Each morning, I prepared a nutritious breakfast and escorted the older child to school. Afterwards, the younger one and I would spend time at the park and library, focusing on educational activities in a Montessori style, as we avoided screen time. I also accompanied them to extracurriculars such as swimming and gymnastics, ensuring they had a well-rounded schedule.</p>
          <p>Additionally, I assisted with household tasks including housekeeping, meal preparation, cleaning, and laundry for the entire family, aiming to create a comfortable environment for everyone. As the younger child started school, our agreed upon reduction in hours took effect, transitioning away from full-time nanny services as mutually discussed. Reflecting on my time with Naya and Sanya, I cherished the opportunity to contribute to their growth and well-being, and I am grateful for the experience gained from such a rewarding role.</p>

          <p>After resigning from my corporate job, I found a beautiful family who hired me as their nanny for their firstborn. I started working with him when he was 2 days old, working 10 hours a day, every day except Sundays. The family wanted me to focus solely on him. My responsibilities included cleaning bottles, cleaning his room, driving him to appointments, meal prepping, sleep training, engaging in various daily activities, and more. I cared for him from newborn until he turned one year old. Eventually, his grandmother moved to the United States and took over his childcare. To this day, we remain in contact, and they consider me part of their extended family.</p>

          <p>The first family I worked with in the United States required specialized care for their newborn, who faced significant health challenges, including seizures and the need for feeding via a g-tube. The baby, born prematurely, remained in the hospital for the first month. I began providing care from day one in the hospital and continued to work with the family until the child reached three years of age. My responsibilities were focused exclusively on the child's care, including maintaining her room, meal preparation, and bottle sterilization. I ensured all activities were educational and screen-free, developing daily routines to foster her development.I worked Monday through Thursday, providing round-the-clock care. My tenure with the family concluded when I needed to relocate to another state to join my husband. Due to a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to use this family as a reference.</p>
